1.what is Springboot?
Spring Boot is a Java framework built on top of the Spring Framework that makes it easier to develop, configure, and deploy applications quickly.

Think of it like this:
Spring Framework = powerful but requires lots of configuration.
Spring Boot = opinionated, auto-configured version of Spring that reduces boilerplate code and setup.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of Spring Boot:
Auto-configuration
It automatically configures your application based on the libraries (dependencies) you include.
Example: If you add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, it configures database connections automatically.
Embedded Servers
No need to deploy to external servers like Tomcat or Jetty separately â€” Spring Boot can run your app inside an embedded server with just java -jar app.jar.
Starter Dependencies
Bundled dependencies for common tasks (e.g., web, JPA, security).
Example: spring-boot-starter-web includes everything needed to build a REST API.
Production-ready Features
Health checks, metrics, logging, monitoring (via Spring Boot Actuator).
Microservices-friendly
Often used to build REST APIs and microservices because of its lightweight nature and fast setup.

âš¡ Example:
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class MyApp {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
ðŸ‘‰ Running this will start a web server and expose http://localhost:8080/ that returns "Hello, Spring Boot!".

âœ… In short:
Spring Boot = Spring made easy â†’ less configuration, faster development, production-ready.
